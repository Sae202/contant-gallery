    <h2> My Name is Sae Almeida</h2>

    <p> Currently enrolled in NJIT, majoring in Industrial Design and minor in UIUX.<br>
        I also have a pet dog, Andrea. She is a Pyredoodle and my favorite member of the family.

    <h2>What does Industrial Design in our major looks like?</h2>
    <p>Simple, we come together and manifest an idea and make them come true through the use of different resources offered in NJIT! Some of the students work is displayed below!</p>
